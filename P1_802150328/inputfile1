Files and Directories or Subdirectories
A file is a sequence of blocks. The i-node corresponding to a file references the 
first data block in the file. Each data block, if not the last block in the file, 
has a reference (the last 4 bytes) to the next block in the file. That reference 
is set to value 0 in the last block of each file. A directory is a file whose content 
(the data it contains in its data blocks) are the names of each of its files, or 
subdirectories, and a number identifying the i-node corresponding to the particular 
file or subdirectory in the disk. For this, we have the following rules. A file name 
is a string of no more than 20 characters (one byte each - ASCII code) long and the 
number identifying an i-node is a 4-byte integer. 

Notice that every non-empty file will contain an integer number (positive value) of 
blocks. If block size is r, then the bytes of those blocks reserved for a file, 
which can be used to store content of the particular file, are the first r-4 bytes; 
the last 4 bytes in each such block stores the index of the next block that is part 
of the file (as described in the previous paragraph). However, if the file is of size 
s, it means that its content occupies s bytes. The number of blocks that it would 
require is ceil(s/(r-4)). The last block of the file may have space available; which 
is space in the disk that is available but cannot be used for any other file; it may 
only be used for the same file it belongs to if that file eventually grows in size; 
for example, if new content is appended to the file.
